# kwiz Ionic

## How to Run

Install the Ionic CLI

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Start developing with

```bash
ionic serve
```

This will open up the app in your browser on port 8100. For a mobile preview, use the browser's built-in features for that.

## Code Quality

We use `eslint` and `prettier` to define consistent code formatting and code quality.

To ensure this consistency, we have a central [repository](https://github.com/kwizapp/kwiz-dotfiles) that contains the configuration for the whole organization.

See these [packages](https://github.com/kwizapp/kwiz-dotfiles/packages) for more information.
